We study stochastic dynamics of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game on random Erd ̈os-R ́enyi and
scale-free Barab ́asi-Albert networks with a cost of maintaining a link between interacting players.
We show that when the cost increases, the population of players located Barab ́asi-Albert network
undergoes a sharp transition from an ordered state, where almost all players cooperate, to a state
in which both cooperators and defectors coexist. At the critical cost, the population oscillates in
time between these two states.
