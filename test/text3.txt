We propose a multilevel stochastic approximation (MLSA) scheme for the
computation of the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) of a
financial loss, which can only be computed via simulations conditional on the
realization of future risk factors. Thus, the problem of estimating its VaR and
ES is nested in nature and can be viewed as an instance of a stochastic approx-
imation problem with biased innovation. In this framework, for a prescribed
accuracy ε, the optimal complexity of a standard stochastic approximation al-
gorithm is shown to be of order ε−3. To estimate the VaR, our MLSA algorithm
attains an optimal complexity of order ε−2−δ , where δ < 1 is some parameter
depending on the integrability degree of the loss, while to estimate the ES, it
achieves an optimal complexity of order ε−2 |ln ε|2. Numerical studies of the
joint evolution of the error rate and the execution time demonstrate how our
MLSA algorithm regains a significant amount of the lost performance due to
the nested nature of the problem
